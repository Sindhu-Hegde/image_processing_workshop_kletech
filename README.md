# Image Processing and Computer Vision Basics Workshop (KLETech)

The structure of the folders (lab1, lab2 and lab3) is as follows:

```
|---- lab/
      |---- Course_Lab_Questions.ipynb (Contains the description and questions)
      |---- Course_Lab_Solutions.ipynb (Contains the entire notebook with solutions)
      |---- images/ (Contains the required input images)
      |---- outputs/ (Contains the outputs saved during execution)
```

**General tips:**
  - Try solving the question notebooks without looking into the solutions.
  - Feel free to read all the concepts in more detail online.
